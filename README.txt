AI agents for the version of the classic Pacman arcade game as developed at UC Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu).


1.	classifierAgents.py: builds a decision tree classifier, then 
implements an ensemble of these trees via bootstrap aggregation in order to return a single classification label as agreed upon by a maximum vote of the ensemble.

2.	mlLearningAgents.py: An exploratory SARSA agent that actively learns Q values for each state-action pair in the Pacman smallGrid environment
